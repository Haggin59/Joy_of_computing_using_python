len(a[])-length
.sort()-ascending order
.reverse()-reversing

list_name.index["c"]- index of c in list

.choice(list)-to choose an element from a list
.sample(list,n)-creates a list of n random elements from list
.randint(a,b)-generate random integer b/w a & b both included
.randrange(a,b,stepvalue)-""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" b excluded
.random()- generate decimal nos b/w 0 & 1

DICTIONARIES
----------
a = {} -creates an empty DICTIONARY
a["key"] = value -inserts the value with key with which it can be referenced
list[a.keys()] -to get list of keys in the DICTIONARY
list[a.values()] -to get list of values in the DICTIONARY
a.items() -to get tuples of ke and corresponding values
del a['key'] -to delete a value
